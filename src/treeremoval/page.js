			You should have received a “Tree Notice” pamphlet on your door (see
			below and attached) that announces trimming of trees in the street
			location (right-of-way) of the Cedars neighborhood. The City of
			Lenexa thought this week or next week for the Cedars subdivision to
			have the tree trimming completed, depending upon weather.
			<br />
			<br />
			This is a reminder to the neighbors so we can get trees trimmed up,
			especially high above the street and sidewalks. If dates change we
			will let you know as soon as possible.
