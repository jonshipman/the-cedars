<Title>Tree Removal</Title>

You should have received a “Tree Notice” pamphlet on your door (see below and attached) that
announces trimming of trees in the street location (right-of-way) of the Cedars neighborhood. The
City of Lenexa thought this week or next week for the Cedars subdivision to have the tree trimming
completed, depending upon weather.
<br />
<br />
This is a reminder to the neighbors so we can get trees trimmed up, especially high above the street
and sidewalks. If dates change we will let you know as soon as possible.
